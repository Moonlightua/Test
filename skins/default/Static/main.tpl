		Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, such as studying, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming.</div>
	<div class="pct-text2">Another term usually associated with calmness is "peace". A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce "good" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including marriage. Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of-control', it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business.</div>
